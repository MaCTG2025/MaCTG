    """
    Loads an RGB image from the specified path, masks the center of each channel with a square of given length and value,
    applies contrast adjustment using the provided alpha and beta values, and saves the resulting image to the output path.

    Args:
        image_path (str): The file path to the input RGB image.
        mask_length (int): The length of the square mask to be applied at the center of each channel.
        mask_value (int): The value to set for the pixels within the masked area (e.g., 1 for white).
        alpha (float): The contrast adjustment factor (gain). A value of 1.0 means no change.
        beta (int): The brightness adjustment factor (bias). A value of 0 means no change.
        output_path (str): The file path where the resulting image will be saved.

    Returns:
        None: The function does not return any value. The processed image is saved to the specified output path.

    Requirements:
        1. The input image must be a valid RGB image.
        2. The mask_length must be a positive integer and should not exceed the dimensions of the image.
        3. The mask_value should be an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive).
        4. The alpha and beta values should be chosen carefully to avoid over-saturation or under-saturation of the image.
        5. The output_path should include the file name and extension (e.g., "output_image.png").
