def process_image(image_path: str) -> None:
    """
    Main function that orchestrates the entire process:
    - Load the image from the specified path.
    - Apply an affine transformation (45Â° rotation, 1.2x scaling, and translation by (50, 30) pixels).
    - Perform Harris corner detection on both the original and transformed images.
    - Save the resulting images as "harris_original.png" and "harris_transformed.png".

    Args:
        image_path (str): The file path of the input image.

    Returns:
        None

    Example:
        >>> process_image("./test_image.png")
